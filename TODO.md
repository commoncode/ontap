## bugs, issues

- Profile view doesn't show Cheers because they don't get passed from /whoami


## new features, improvements

- User management
- Clientside validation for KegEdit component
- Improve for mobile!

## cleanup/refactor:

- consolidate the CSS; probably remove the modules because they're shit.
- Implement autoLoader everywhere we're using Loader
- Consistent patterns for all of the stores
- Make the CRUD forms all implement EditForm component
