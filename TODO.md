## bugs, issues


## new features, improvements

- Breweries model
- Improve for mobile!
- Clientside validation for KegEdit component


## cleanup/refactor:

- consolidate the CSS; probably remove the modules because they're shit.
- Implement autoLoader everywhere we're using Loader
- Consistent patterns for all of the stores
- Make the CRUD forms all implement EditForm component
