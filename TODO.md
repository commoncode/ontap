## bugs, issues

## new features, improvements

- Breweries model
- Improve for mobile!
- Clientside validation for KegEdit component
- Prevent Cheersing a yet-to-be-tapped keg. Requires fixing the default Invalid Date issue on the Keg.
- cheersKeg() in api should just return the new Cheers and the KegId, not the kitchen sink
- API tests: auth, nested objects, expected attributes etc


## cleanup/refactor:

- migrate to prop-types from React.propTypes
- a CSS styleguide would be nice
- Implement autoLoader everywhere we're using Loader
- Consistent patterns for all of the stores
- Make the CRUD forms all implement EditForm component
