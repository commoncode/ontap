## bugs

 - fix tap detail view


## functionality

- Break the beer detail votes into a sub component, move edit/delete beer buttons out
- Add a beer detail kegs view (current/past kegs)
- Tap change could probably sit inside tap list view
- Universal handling of loaders (recompose/branch?)
- Clientside validation for KegEdit component

## needs styling:

- tap detail view


## cleanup/refactor:

- consolidate the CSS; probably remove the modules because they're shit.
